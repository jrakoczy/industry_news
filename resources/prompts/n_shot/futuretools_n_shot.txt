Here's a sample list of articles:

1. Title: Hala Point: Intel reveals world's biggest 'brain-inspired' neuromorphic computer. 
2. Title: An update on Amazon's plans for Just Walk Out and checkout-free technology. 
3. Title: Boston Dynamicsâ€™ Atlas humanoid robot goes electric. 
4. Title: Google will provide AI to the National Guard for disaster response. 
5. Title: Google will pump more than $100B into AI says DeepMind boss. 
6. Title: Logitech announces AI Prompt Builder software with matching mouse. 
7. Title: Microsoft announces new industrial AI innovations from the cloud to the factory floor.

And here's an expected output:

  "reasonings": [
    "Intel's 'brain-inspired' neuromorphic computer may signify a significant leap in computing architectures that could advance AI's capabilities. However, creating such hardware requires resources beyond a small startup team's scope, focusing more on potential applications rather than creating the hardware itself.",
    "Amazon's Just Walk Out technology is innovative for retail but largely focuses on hardware and operations rather than software services that can be developed by a small team. It does not describe a specific breakthrough in AI/ML suitable for startup exploitation.",
    "The electrification of Boston Dynamics' Atlas robot does not present a direct software product or service opportunity for a small startup team. It is a hardware update with no clear AI/ML breakthrough mentioned.",
    "Google's partnership to provide AI for disaster response implies the use of AI in critical, real-world applications, which could inspire similar AI solutions from startups focused on emergency and disaster management software.",
    "DeepMind's investment announcement is about financial commitment rather than technological innovation. It indicates a positive environment for AI development but doesn't present a specific breakthrough or startup idea.",
    "Logitech's AI Prompt Builder software represents a direct application of AI in improving user experience and productivity, suitable for replication or inspiration by a small developer team in creating similar software tools.",
    "Microsoft's announcement about industrial AI from cloud to factory floor involves AI application in manufacturing and large-scale industrial settings, which typically requires significant resources and integration, less suitable for a small startup focused solely on software."
